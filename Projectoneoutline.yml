Project One:
  - Presentation next Tuesday.
  - Individual, but collaborate.

Abstract:
  - Build an infrastructure of multiple web servers serving one web application developed on 
    Node/Express that mimics an online storage system such as google drive, or dropbox for images only. 
  - 3 or more Virtual Machines for fault-tolerance, thus creating High-Avaliability and complexity.
  - We will use file/blob storage, need to be redundant.
  - A non-relational database, need to be redundant.
  - A relational database, need to be redundant.
  - Avaliability sets (3).
  - We will use a scale set (3).
  - Aim for automation.
  - May use or need Node/Express, html, css, js, bash.
